# Project Overview
**Project Pixel Art Marker** Is an Udacity Project that I made on class and I Uploaded here to complete Udacity **Project 5: Optimize GitHub profile** on this project I will describe the **Project Pixel Art Marker**

# Pixel Art Maker 

## Pixel Art Maker Project Project Overview
This project use the skills of JavaScript and asks you to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

Your goal is to build out the **design.js** file to achieve all the interactive elements on the page!

## Description
You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

## Skills Need it
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

* Defining variables with const and let
* Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables
## Instructions
Now, open up **design.js**. As you start writing your code, keep these three tasks in mind:

  1. **Define your variables** by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where your JavaScript variables can come into play! For instance, the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.
  2. **Add event listeners** to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.
  3. **Set the size of the cross stitch canvas** as an _N_ by _M_ grid with the makeGrid() function. Use your knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell should have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.

Now test it! When you're done, you should be able to create a canvas of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and click on the canvas's table cells to set their color.
